./maxflow-v3.03.src - C++ code by Vladimir Kolmogorov (the code was slightly modified)
http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software/maxflow-v3.03.src.zip

./graphCutDynamicMex.mexw64, ./updateGraphCutDynamicMex.mexw64, ./deleteGraphCutDynamicMex.mexw64 - Win_x64 binary files for the MEX-functions compiled using MATLAB R2014a + MSVC 2012

./graphCutDynamicMex.mexa64, ./updateGraphCutDynamicMex.mexa64, ./deleteGraphCutDynamicMex.mexa64 - Linux_x64 binary files for the MEX-functions compiled using MATLAB R2012a + gcc-4.4

USING THE CODE
-----------------------------

0) Install MATLAB and one of the supported compilers

1) Run build_graphCutDynamicMex.m

2) Run example_graphCutDynamicMex.m to check if the code works

The code was tested under 
- Win7-x64 using MATLAB R2014a and MSVC 2012;
- ubuntu-12.04-x64 using MATLAB R2012a and gcc-4.4

OTHER PACKAGES
-----------------------------

* BK max-flow/min-cut algorithm without the support of dynamic graph cuts:
https://github.com/aosokin/graphCutMex_BoykovKolmogorov

If you need to solve just one graph cut problem you probably do not need dynamic graph cuts.

* IBFS max-flow/min-cut algorithm: https://github.com/aosokin/graphCutMex_IBFS

The IBFS algorithm has polynomial time runtime guarantees. The BK does not.
In my experience BK works faster for graphs built for standard 4(8)-connected grid MRFs.
If the graph becomes more complicated (especially hierarchical) consider trying IBFS instead.

* QPBO algorithm
https://github.com/aosokin/qpboMex

If you need to minimize energy with just a few non-submodular edges try using the QPBO algorithm
